A "playground" of backtracking programs

Backtracking is a concept of finding all or some possible solutions to a computational problem by building partial solutions. 
For each partial solution, the backtracking algorithm runs a test to determine its validity. If the 
partial solution happens to be invalid, it would "backtrack" to build a different part of the solution; 
otherwise, the backtracker would continue until it reaches a certain goal. 

## Objective 
* To understand a general algorithm in computer science for finding all possible solutions to a computational problem. 
* To build the understructure of a backtracker for a given problem.
* To learn the different categories of problems that would require a backtracking algorithm.
* To analyze the computational complexity and performance for a backtracker. 
* To show appreciation for an algorithm that may be inefficient for certain computational problems. 
* To explore different languages to program a backtracking algorithm.
