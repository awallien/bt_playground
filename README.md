A "playground" of backtracking programs

Backtracking is a concept of finding possible solutions to a computational problem by building partial solutions in order to
acheive a certain goal. For each partial solution, the backtracking algorithm runs a test to determine the
validity of a partial solution. If the partial solutions happens to be invalid, it would "backtrack" to build a different
solution; otherwise, the backtracker would continue until it reaches the certain goal. 

## Objective 
* To understand a general algorithm in computer science for finding all possible solutions to a computational problem. 
* To build the understructure of a backtracker for a given problem.
* To learn the different categories of problems that would require a backtracking algorithm.
* To analyze the computational complexity and performance for a backtracker. 
* To show appreciation for an algorithm that may be inefficient for certain computational problems. 
* To explore different languages to program a backtracking algorithm.
