# Binairo

Binairo is a puzzle game involving two symbols, 0s and 1s or black and white, on a square grid.
The goal of the puzzle is to fill the board with the symbols such that there is an equal number
of symbols in each row and column, no more than two of either symbols are adjacent to each other,
and that each row and column on the grid are unique.

The figure below illustrates an example of the initial grid of a binairo puzzle board and the solution to the puzzle.
